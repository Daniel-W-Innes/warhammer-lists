### Total: [500pts] ###

### Selection Rules ###


    **Deadly Demise 1:** Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").

    **Leader:** While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.

    **Rad bombardment:** BOMBARDMENT
At the start of the first battle round, for each enemy unit within your opponent's deployment zone, your opponent must decide whether that unit will take cover or stand firm. If a unit takes cover, until the end of the battle round, that unit is Battle-shocked. If a unit stands firm, roll one D6 for that unit: on a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.


FALLOUT
At the start of the second, third, fourth and fifth battle rounds, roll one D6 for each enemy unit within your opponent's deployment zone. On a 3+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

    **Scouts 6":** Some units have ‘Scouts x’ listed in their abilities. If every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x" as if it were your Movement phase – as can any DEDICATED TRANSPORT model such a unit starts the battle embarked within (provided only models with this ability are embarked within that DEDICATED TRANSPORT model). A unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.
